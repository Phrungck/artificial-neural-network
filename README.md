## Artificial Neural Networks | Support Vector Machines | Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
A simple implementation of artificial neural networks using numpy as randomizers and python function only. This could still be improved by using faster functions in Numpy. Additionally, Synthethic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was also used to handle class imbalance.
